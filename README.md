# OpenClaw Agentic Operating System Workspace

This workspace is set up to create and maintain the OpenClaw Agentic Operating System Build Procedure and supporting operating documents.

OpenClaw is the system orchestration runtime: it turns governed intent into executed actions while enforcing policy and preserving an auditable memory trail.

## Purpose
- Define a repeatable procedure for creating and validating the OpenClaw Agentic Operating System.
- Keep procedure steps, prerequisites, and verification records in one place.

## Workspace Contents
- `docs/OpenClaw-Agentic-Operating-System-Build-Procedure.md` — primary build procedure document.
- `templates/Procedure-Template.md` — reusable template for additional procedures.
- `assets/` — place diagrams or reference images if needed.

## How to Use
1. Open `docs/OpenClaw-Agentic-Operating-System-Build-Procedure.md`.
2. Replace placeholder values with your environment details.
3. Keep the verification and rollback sections updated for every revision.
4. For any new initiative, start with `docs/Project-Startup-Guide.md` to reference all required AOS documents.

## Notes
- This workspace is documentation-focused and has no build/compile step.
- If you add scripts later, update this README with usage instructions.
